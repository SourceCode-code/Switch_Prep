   - Practice: Participate in Agile ceremonies, and try out Jira/Confluence for sprint management.
   - Milestone: Pass the PSM1 certification exam.

5. DSA in JavaScript (2 months)
   - Why: Knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is essential for technical interviews and problem-solving.
   - Learning Path:
     - Course: JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures - freeCodeCamp
     - Practice: Solve problems on LeetCode, HackerRank.
   - Milestone: Solve 50-100 problems on platforms like LeetCode. Target easy and medium-level problems first.

6. Soft Skills: Communication and Problem-Solving (Ongoing)
   - Why: Senior roles require better communication and problem-solving abilities.
   - Learning Path:
     - Book: Crucial Conversations by Patterson, Grenny, et al.
     - Podcast: TestGuild Automation Testing Podcast
   - Milestone: Actively contribute to meetings, explaining test strategies and findings confidently.

Phase 3: Advanced Technical & Job Transition Preparation (2-3 months)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Fullstack Automation Engineer (Optional but Beneficial)
   - Why: Becoming a full-stack automation engineer expands your technical horizons and increases your market value.
   - Learning Path:
     - Course: Fullstack Test Automation with Playwright
   - Milestone: Implement an end-to-end test strategy, from backend APIs to frontend UI.

8. Interview Prep & Job Search (2 months)
   - Resume Building: Update your resume with new skills, GitHub contributions, and certifications.
     - Resource: Resume Templates - Novoresume
   - Mock Interviews: Practice with peers or platforms like Pramp, focusing on DSA and automation.
   - Job Portals: Target mid-senior roles via LinkedIn, Naukri, and specialized job boards like AngelList.
   - Salary Negotiation: Research industry standards and confidently negotiate based on your newly acquired skills.
     - Resource: Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss (for salary negotiation tips).

9. Certifications and Portfolio
   - Add the following to your resume:
     - PSM1 Certification (Agile Proficiency)
     - Playwright, Cypress Automation Skills (via GitHub projects)
     - GitHub Actions/CI-CD Pipelines (for automation testing)
     - DSA Proficiency (with competitive coding experience)
